      "King of Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you\n",
      "give me a cup of tea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In a moment. A propos,\" she added, becoming calm again, \"I am\n",
      "expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart,\n",
      "who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of\n",
      "the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good\n",
      "ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He\n",
      "has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall be delighted to meet them,\" said the prince. \"But tell me,\"\n",
      "he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred\n",
      "to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive\n",
      "of his visit, \"is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke\n",
      "to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts\n",
      "is a poor creature.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others\n",
      "were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it\n",
      "for the baron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she\n",
      "nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or\n",
      "was pleased with.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her\n",
      "sister,\" was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna's face suddenly assumed an\n",
      "expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\n",
      "sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\n",
      "patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron\n",
      "Funke, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the\n",
      "womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna\n",
      "Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of\n",
      "a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,\n",
      "so she said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came\n",
      "out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly\n",
      "beautiful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I often think,\" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer\n",
      "to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that\n",
      "political and social topics were ended and the time had come for\n",
      "intimate conversation- \"I often think how unfairly sometimes the\n",
      "joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid\n",
      "children? I don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like\n",
      "him,\" she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her\n",
      "eyebrows. \"Two such charming children. And really you appreciate\n",
      "them less than anyone, and so you don't deserve to have them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't help it,\" said the prince. \"Lavater would have said I\n",
      "lack the bump of paternity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I\n",
      "am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves\" (and her\n",
      "face assumed its melancholy expression), \"he was mentioned at Her\n",
      "Majesty's and you were pitied....\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\n",
      "awaiting a reply. He frowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What would you have me do?\" he said at last. \"You know I did all\n",
      "a father could for their education, and they have both turned out\n",
      "fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active\n",
      "one. That is the only difference between them.\" He said this smiling\n",
      "in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles\n",
      "round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse\n",
      "and unpleasant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a\n",
      "father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,\" said Anna\n",
      "Pavlovna, looking up pensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my\n",
      "children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That\n",
      "is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a\n",
      "gesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.\n",
